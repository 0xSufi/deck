# Noma Protocol Information
Noma is a next-gen DeFi launchpad live on Monad testnet, aiming to revolutionize the sad status-quo of token launches. With fairness baked at protocol level and programmatic liquidity, tokens launched through Noma offer innovative features such as: 

- Configurable liquidity curve 
- Liquidation free loans
- Native staking
- Fair revenue sharing with project founders

## For founders
### Problem: Distribution is hard
The fair distribution of cryptographic assets has proven to be a hard problem: today, cryptocurrencies and tokens are distributed to users through a variety of methods, including public and private sales. While these methods are efficient, for many projects, it is hard to maintain a balance between fairness and transparency and, at the same time, ensure that the tokenomics are sustainable and aligned with the interests of all stakeholders. This can lead to a number of issues, including:

Rug pulls: where the project team or insiders sell their tokens and leave the project, leaving investors with worthless assets.
Liquidity issues: where the project team or insiders control the liquidity of the token, leading to price manipulation and lack of trust from investors.

### Solution: Automated tokenomics
The Noma protocol is designed to overcome the issues of traditional distribution methods by providing a novel way to launch tokens that seed their own liquidity. For each Noma token (oToken), the protocol acts as a market making middleware for the liquidity it controls, while the algorithmic structure of the liquidity guarantees the protocol can buy back the whole circulating supply at any time. In addition, the protocol revenue stream is fed back into the liquidity, which helps to increase the floor price of tokens over time. The liquidity is programmable, which means it can be adjusted to meet the needs of a project in terms of desired market structure and reactivity to market conditions.

## For holders
### Problem: Broken expectations
In today's world, the cryptocurrency industry has become a cut-throat environment, where the majority of projects are designed to extract value from users rather than provide them with real utility. This has led to a lack of trust and confidence in the industry, as users are often left feeling exploited and disillusioned. The traditional model of token distribution has also contributed to this problem, as it often leads to a concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few insiders, while leaving the majority of users with little or no stake in the project.


### Solution: A change of paradigm
The Noma protocol provides a novel way for projects to launch tokens with transparency and fairness baked into the protocol at code level. With this innovative model, the circulating outside the protocol's control must be backed 1:1 by real liquidity, at the floor price. This means that the protocol can buy back the whole circulating supply at any time, while guaranteeing the price will ever reach a determined level. In addition, the liquidity is controlled by the protocol itself, rather than by insiders or the project team. This creates a sustainable and aligned economy that benefits all stakeholders, rather than just a select few.
